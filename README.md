Solve Sudoku's from the command line with visuals, slow and fast solving, and more.

Inspired by Leet Code #37 I wanted to create a way to solve puzzles without
using brute force methods. This program uses the MINUET method as described
in as proposed by Carlos F. Daganzo in the 2018 paper
"MINUET: A METHOD TO SOLVE SUDOKU PUZZLES BY HAND"
